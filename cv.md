## Description  
I am currently working as a motion designer, I wanted to practice programming and get skills. In the future I would like to work as a full stack programmer. Also at the university I studied some programming languages, but at that time I chose computer graphics, now I decided to go deeper into programming as it gives much more room for development in many directions.
